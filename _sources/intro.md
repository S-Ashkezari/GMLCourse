# Introduction

This book serves as an educational resource on **Graph Mining** and **Machine Learning with Graphs**, developed specifically for students of **Ferdowsi University of Mashhad**.

It begins by exploring fundamental **graph mining concepts** â€” including how to analyze, extract, and interpret meaningful patterns from graph-structured data.  
Building on this foundation, the book then introduces the principles and algorithms of **Graph Machine Learning**, where graph theory meets modern machine learning to model complex relational data.

The material is primarily based on the book:

**Graph Machine Learning**  
*Take graph data to the next level by applying machine learning techniques and algorithms*  
by Claudio Stamile, Aldo Marzullo, and Enrico Deusebio  
GitHub repository: [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Graph-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Graph-Machine-Learning)

Additional insights are drawn from:

- The excellent article: [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) by *Distill*  
- Various other reliable online sources that enrich the understanding of graph-based learning.

The goal of this book is to offer a **structured, conceptual, and hands-on** guide for students and researchers interested in **analyzing graph data** and **building intelligent models** that leverage the power of graph structures.

We hope this book becomes a valuable companion on your learning journey.

# Introduction

This book is an educational resource for **Machine Learning with Graphs**, prepared specifically for use in the course at **Ferdowsi University of Mashhad**.

It is based primarily on the book:

**Graph Machine Learning**  
*Take graph data to the next level by applying machine learning techniques and algorithms*  
by Claudio Stamile, Aldo Marzullo, and Enrico Deusebio  
GitHub repository: [https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Graph-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Graph-Machine-Learning)

In addition, we draw inspiration and insights from:

- The excellent article: [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) by *Distill*
- Various other trusted websites and resources that provide valuable content on graph-based machine learning.

The goal of this book is to provide a structured, practical, and conceptual guide for students and researchers interested in leveraging graph structures in machine learning applications.

We hope this book serves as a useful companion throughout your learning journey.
